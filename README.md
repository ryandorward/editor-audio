This module allows you to add an Audio button to the CKEditor toolbar, which lets users upload audio files into content, and display it using the Html5 element.

Installation
Download and enable the module as usual
Go to your filters admin (admin/config/content/formats)
Edit the format on which you want to add the audio upload tool
Drag the "speaker" icon to the "Active toolbar"
*** IMPORTANT *** If the "Limit allowed HTML tags and correct faulty HTML" filter is enabled, Add: to "Allowed HTML Tags" in the settings vertical tabs.
Save
Credit
This module is basically a fork of the Editor File upload module by DuaelFr, re-jigged for Html5 audio. Full credit to the creator of that module for their excellent work!
